# Is GAI the same as superintelligence?

On the face of it GAI and Superintelligence (SI) are different concepts. GAI simply requires that an entity can apply its intelligence in novel and adaptable ways. Not constrained to solving a predetermined set of problems. Superintelligence requires that an entity can act in ways that at least encompass all human abilities. This sometimes includes abilities that would otherwise be considered supernatural, such as mind reading, future predicting and manipulating matter.
