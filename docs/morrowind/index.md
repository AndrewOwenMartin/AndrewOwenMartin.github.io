# Morrowind journal

A test to see if I can write a CRPG Addict-style entry on my time in Morrowind.

So far I, gave Fargoth his ring.
Bought a spear.
Went looking near the lighthouse for trash, which I solds all to Arille.
Learned I could find valuable pearls from Kopis
Found a tomb and learned that I had enough mana to summon two ancestral ghosts, after that I left, and on the circuitous route back to Seda Neen I ate a load of plants and found a dead body. Asking around I went to beardy who told me to look for the killer, found him, killed him just about, I couldn't rest anywhere so muscled it out and now have a place.
I heard to give the name of a man to a silt strider, sensing a mission I did so, but just got some gossip, when I gave it back to the man he offered to sell me a ring, but it sounded awful.
When looking for a place to rest I learned people shake down the locals and was offered to join in but decided not to. Wen trying to side with Fargoth he got angry.

Then I took the siltstrider to Balmora and followed directions to Caius. He game me some quests and told me to meet all the blades trainers, I made it my first job to visit them. I'm also interested in the Imperical Cult, Cais said I'd have to go to Fort Moonmoth to join and then, if I want to be a "lay servant" to go to Ebonheart.

When in the Mages guild, I heard that Larrius Varro at Fort Moonmoth was looking for me, so I made that my next port of call.

Ajira at the Balmora Mages guild has some basic potions for levitation and invisibility. They also want me to collect for them some,
- Luminour Russula
- Violet Coprinus
- Bungler's Bane
- Hypha Facia

dwinna of the Ald-ruhn Mages guild asked me to find for her a copy of Chronicles of Ncholeft

Folms Mirel in Caldera offered to locate and pay for ten propylon indices. I told him I'm up to the task but the first one is in a shop owned by Irgola in Caldera. He took it after I bought it with a bit of bartering and told me the next one is in St. Olms in Vivec, probably unguarded.

I popped over to Vivec to see if I could find the index and went past the Figher's guild, inside I found an enchanted ring I'll use for practice, and Lorbumol gro-Aglakh suggested I retrieve a Juiceday Feather Ring from Nar gro-Sagramph in Vivc Hlaalu Canton Plaza.
