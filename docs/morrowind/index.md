# Morrowind journal

A test to see if I can write a CRPG Addict-style entry on my time in Morrowind.

So far I, gave Fargoth his ring.
Bought a spear.
Went looking near the lighthouse for trash, which I solds all to Arille.
Learned I could find valuable pearls from Kopis
Found a tomb and learned that I had enough mana to summon two ancestral ghosts, after that I left, and on the circuitous route back to Seda Neen I ate a load of plants and found a dead body. Asking around I went to beardy who told me to look for the killer, found him, killed him just about, I couldn't rest anywhere so muscled it out and now have a place.
I heard to give the name of a man to a silt strider, sensing a mission I did so, but just got some gossip, when I gave it back to the man he offered to sell me a ring, but it sounded awful.
When looking for a place to rest I learned people shake down the locals and was offered to join in but decided not to. Wen trying to side with Fargoth he got angry.
