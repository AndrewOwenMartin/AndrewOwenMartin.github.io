# Intro - Seyda Neen

I identified myself.

and described my background

I was then given directions to an Imperial Agent.  After leaving, I was immediately accosted by a Bosmer, Fargoth.

He informed me that a local tax collector, Processus Vitellius, had gone missing and that there were some "rough customers" holed up locally. I saw a local lighthouse and climbed up to survey the town. I could immediately see there was nothing of value for me in this town so I decided to make straight for my contact.

Before leaving town I decided to stop in on Arrille who was recommended to me by Fargoth. Arrille suggested I speak to a patron Hrisskar who was having some financial issues. He has meagre wares, and I had even fewer resources, nevertheless I decided to buy a cheap spear, bow and a handful of arrows to keep any local fauna away, in return I traded him my useless Empire-issue shoes, but he seemed to have rather preferred that I didn't. Hrisskar was in the tavern but seemed to be running a lousy protection racket, and asked me to help him shaking down Fargoth. I gave him short shrift and moved on. I overheard someone lost "Mentor's Ring" in a tomb along the Bitter Coast. I'll remember that if I go that way.

As soon as I left Seyda Neen I was faced with a decision, to walk West along the coast, East over land, or to take a silt strider. It was a fine day and I prefer the water, so I decided to walk.

Within seconds of starting on the path I saw an opportunity to try my new bow, and see how rusty my skills were. I managed to skewer a few local bugs, but had to fall back to my spear when charged by a rat. Nevertheless I think I should be safe if I stick to the coastal roads. However, amongst some beast I found a body in the undergrowth. His belongings confirmed him to be the previously mentioned tax collector Processus Vitellius. Cursing my luck, I strolled back into town.

A guard suggested I report to Socucius Ergalla, who processed my release, and he then offered to pay me for investigating the murder. My gregarious friend Fargoth told me he wasn't liked by anybody but the lighthouse keeper Thavere. I still wanted to leave this town as soon as possible, but this seemed like a simple enough chore. On arriving at the lighthouse I did a little more target practice. Four arrows was enough, but I'll be in trouble with anything more agile than a mudcrab.

A quick discussion with Thavere pointed to Foryn Gilnith who had arguments with Processus about the amount of taxes he was collecting. I easily located his shack in a slum and as soon as I raised the question of the tax collector he admitted to the murder and proceeded to punch my lights out. I barely survived, but my quick reactions and training with the spear allowed me to best him. I've been here mere hours and I've killed a native. This small favor for the empire might be for the best if the eye of the Emperor is on me. In his shack I found a weakly enchanted sword, a book about bartering and some basic food items which I took for myself as it would be useful if I'm going to be running everywhere. Socucius seemed impressed and gave me 500 gold. I gave to Thavere a ring I found on Foryn which had sentimental value for her. She gave me a couple of health potions.

As a water lover I decided to quickly dive for pearls in the shores around Seyda Neen. I managed to find only one pearl and the murderous aquatic wildlife cost me one health potion. Arrille took it off my hands. I decide it's prudent to take a scroll of Almsivi Intervention, though I hope to be casting the spell myself before too long.

![Diving for pearls](./screenshots/009-diving-for-pearls.png)

Before attempting once again to leave town I take note of the alchemical reagents in my collection.

- Bungler's Bane. Drain Speed
- Hypha Facia. Drain Luck
- Luminous Russula. Water Breathing
- Violet Coprinus. Water Walking
- Ampoule Pod. Water Walking
- Scrib Jelly. Fortify Willpower
- Saltrice and Crab Meat. Restore Fatigue

If I need water walking, I know what to do. Once again, I'm distracted mere seconds after leaving town, I see the entrance to Addamasartus and recognise it as the smuggler cave mentioned earlier. I steel myself and enter, prepared to run, fight or use my intervention scrolls as I see fit. Someone attacks me as soon as I enter, I get off a couple of arrows and spear them with little trouble. A little further in to the cave I have magic spells thrown at me, but I manage to dodge them or stay out of touch range, thanks to my spear. A third smuggler similarly poses little trouble. With the danger averted I look around and find a small array of more or less worthless items, some contraband and a nice shirt that makes me feel a little better about myself. I also locate some slaves who I have no hesitation in freeing. I could sell some of what I found to Arrille, but I've dawdled enough. While looking through the spoils I was intrigued to note that both Marshmarrow and Wickwheat are known to Restore Health, this will be most useful once I'm good enough with a pestle and mortar. If only I knew how to restore magicka.

- Spore Pod. Drain Strength
- Rat Meat. Drain Magicka
- Marshmarrow and Wickwheat both do Restore Health
- Draggle Tail. Drain Personality

Starting my journey to Balmora in earnest, as destined, another distraction. A Bosmer who I learned is named Tarhiel fell from the sky with a scream and sickening crunch. I learned he was developing scrolls of quite remarkable power, too much power for this individual, who managed to launch himself to the sky, but before landing lost all abilities to handle such flights. I took his journal such that others may learn from it, and his fine hat which I found utterly irresistible.


![Tarhiel](./screenshots/011-found-tarhiel.png)

Leaving all else I followed the path until it diverted through a mountain pass. Feeling more comfortable following the coast I left the path and decided to stroll along, keeping my feet wet in the water and my spear sharp in the shells of mudcrabs. I passed by the Samarys Ancestral Tomb, and suspecting this may be where the Mentor's Ring is located, I crept inside. I was admiring the work and the offerings when an Ancestral Ghost made me aware how unwelcome I was, I turned and fled, knowing I could come back later, stronger and better equipped, if I really needed to.


![The Samarys Ancestral Tomb](./screenshots/012-samarys-ancestral-tomb.png)

A bit further along the coast I was surprised to see an unguarded and abandoned chest, containing a silver longsword in perfect condition, no less. Further investigation showed that it was part of a shipwreck. I explored inside to learn more and found the most unexpected but most welcome things inside. A handful of diamonds, moon sugar and gold. There was a corpse and a crate containing a pair of much nicer pants than I was wearing. There were also four ash statues, which were most sinister.

![Shipwreck](./screenshots/013-shipwreck.png)

After the shipwreck I could see Hla Oad a little further down the coast, but this was also where the river Oad let in, I did a mixture of swimming up the river and water-walking over it to reach Balmora by the south wall. I saw hills in the distance across town so I climbed them to view the whole of Balmora from the North.

![Balmora from the North](./screenshots/014-balmora-from-north.png)

As instructed in my release package, I headed for the South Wall Corner Club to ask for directions to Caius Cosades. On the way I investigated abandoned bins around town and found a few pieces of gold, various potions, some enchanted throwing stars and an amulet of summoning skeletal minions. This would certainly help me stay away from trouble.

I located Caius Cosades in the North West corner of town. He welcomed me to the blades and told me he had orders for me, but that I would be better served improving my own skills and standing before being too eager to proceed. I asked for details on the orders, and he told me more information would come from Hasphat Antabolis in the Fighter's Guild, but more importantly I should join any guild that would take me and introduce myself to the Blades Trainers. They're spread around a bit.
- Balmora: Rithleen, Tyermaillin, Nine-Toes.
- Caldera: Surane Leoriane.
- Ald'ruhn: Gildan, Sjorvar Horse-Mouth.
- Seyda Neen: Elone.

Not wanting to upset my new mentor, or to get too involved too quickly, I joined all the guilds in town (Mages, Fighters, and Thieves), and set off to visit the Blades trainers.

![Caius Cosades](./screenshots/015-caius-cosades.png)

I unloaded all my Skooma and Moon Sugar to Ra'Virr, in return for a magical spear. Fasile Charascel in the Fighter's Guild told me Larrius Varro in Fort Moonmoth was looking for me. I bumped into Hasphat in passing and he told me his hope for me was that I retrieved a Dwemer puzzle box from a local Dwemer ruin called Arkngthand, I felt this should come after my current plans. I also received Fighter's Guild orders to clear out some rats from the north side of Balmora, Theives Guild orders to deliver a diamond, and Mages Guild orders to retrieve mushrooms.

I remembered the mushrooms from Seyda Neen, so I decided to Silt Strider there to speak to Elone and maybe try my luck in the Samarys Ancestral Tomb once more. I spent all my money on some Bonemould armour at the local amourer so I expect to be a tougher customer.
I gave Hassabi of the thieves guild a diamond I found in the shipwreck and learned the next task was to pickpocket the key to Nerano Manor. I'm certainly not subtle enough for that so I put my thieves guild career on hold. When given the task I was hinted towards Alcarya of White Haven for diamonds so I made a note to drop in later. In the mages guild I comissioned some cheap spells to practise my two preferred schools. The Balmora trainers gave me heavy armour, moon sugar and an alembic. I'll hold on to the alchemy apparatus, but handed the rest directly to my merchant contacts in town.
I'm not too proud to admit I helped myself to the contents of the Supply Chests of both the Mages Guild and Fighters guild.

Elone gave me a book of maps of dubious value. Though my new armour, spear, and skeletal companion made light work of the Samaran temple guardians. I found the mentor's ring im an urn, the urn was trapped with a viscious bite, but a swiftly quaffed potion kept me upright.

larrius varro, miles gloriosus in Andus tradehouse in maar gan for a chat.

My intention, when visiting the Balmora Temple, was to check for spells and any prospect of joining, it was not to short change Ajira. As it transpired, I found not only my favoured mark, recall, and intervention spells but also the flowers I was tasked to collect. I returned these and soon got caught up in the petty squabbles of the mages guild associates.

I own my own Pestle and Mortar now, so can practice making my own restorative potions. I shant stray beyond health and fatigue until I improve my skills and equipment, but it will do for now. I saw some grandmaster equipment in Alcarya's, and without meaning to give too much away, was right that she had some diamonds hidden upstairs.

It was time to take advantage of Mages Guild transport. In Caldera I learned of Propylon indexes and found some cheap enchanted trinkets. In Sadrith Mora I was welcomed into the Great House Telvanni.
