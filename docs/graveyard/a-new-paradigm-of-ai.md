I'm inspired to write this article as every time I see a headline about a "new" way of AI or discussing how modern AI has to change I always think it's going to address the ideas here, but it never does.

To be completely honest this paradigm is not exactly "new" as it has its roots in the very foundation of AI but there is enough unexplored conceptualnspace that an entire paradigm can be scoped out and identified.

The main characteristic of this new way is that an intelligent system will be able to maintain a number of real-time dynamics with phases that resonate with other real-time dynamics in the system and in the environment.
