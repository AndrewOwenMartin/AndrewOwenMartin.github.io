Here's what I want to convince you of.

- The big problem in AI is situational awareness.
- Universal formal solutions are the opposite of situational awareness.
- Situational awareness implies learned biases.
- Non-universal solutions are always imperfect.

# How to get there

- Singularity is near

  AI will solve anything, don't miss the boat.
  This book was the one which gave me combined feelings of optimism and complaicency.
  Utopia was not only going to happen, but guaranteed to happen.
- Reconstructing the Cognitive World

  AI is Rational and Cartesian. The mind is Situated and Heideggarian.
  This was the big shift in my view, it didn't come quickly and it didn't come easily.
  Wheeler's argument can be massively oversimplified as "Orthodox AI can be identified as being fundamentally an expression of 16th Century philosophy of mind such as written by Descartes. Cartesian philosophy has problems long since revealed by 20th Century "Continental" Philosophers, such as Heidegger. Heideggerian philosophy has ideas which can be applied i AI which result in surprisingly 'natural' behaviour which are tricky to achieve with "Orthodox" AI.
- What Computers can't do

  AI isn't just hard but hopelessly misguided.
- WHAIFAHFIRMIMH

  There have been some sincere attempts to make Heideggarian AI but they were not strong enough.
- No Free Lunch Theorems for Search

  Performing well on one data set implies worse performance on the problem. This has severe implications for Supervised Learning and possibly also all algorithms. I.e. A context sensitive and unbiased algorithm cannot exist.

- How Brains Make Up Their Minds

  Natural Neural Networks are dynamic and really implement different transient feed forward networks. Training is not separate from doing.

- Minimally cognitive agents

next articles
1. is it true that GAI requires being totally objective and at least somewhat subjective at the same time? Is it the case that even if you have a countably infinite number of cycles, you can't analyse an uncountably infinite number of options?
2. am I justified in my strong use of the no free lunch theorems?

so this is a test of Google voice typing I want to see if there's any good for writing technical articles walking down the high street nowjust blabbering on not using any particular voice might be might be speaking speaking a bit louder I feel quite normal soso what's the item I want to justify non-rational list theories of mind I want I want to have something to prove to where people make unjustified claims or claims about AI that clearly show they've got a underlying philosophy they didn't realise

online learning is the key. learn "whilst" doing, not separate phases.

Cellular Automata appear lifelike because they simulate the environment.
