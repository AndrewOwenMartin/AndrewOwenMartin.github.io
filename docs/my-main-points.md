Here's what I want to convince you of.

- The big problem in AI is situational awareness.
- Universal formal solutions are the opposite of situational awareness.
- Situational awareness implies learned biases.
- Non-universal solutions are always imperfect.

# How to get there

- Singularity is near

  AI will solve anything, don't miss the boat.
- Reconstructing the Cognitive World

  AI is Rational and Cartesian. The mind is Situated and Heideggarian.
- What Computers can't do

  AI isn't just hard but hopelessly misguided.
- WHAIFAHFIRMIMH

  There have been some sincere attempts to make Heideggarian AI but they were not strong enough.
- No Free Lunch Theorems for Search

  Performing well on one data set implies worse performance on the problem. This has severe implications for Supervised Learning and possibly also all algorithms. I.e. A context sensitive and unbiased algorithm cannot exist.

- How Brains Make Up Their Minds

  Natural Neural Networks are dynamic and really implement different transient feed forward networks. Training is not separate from doing.

1. is it true that GAI requires being totally objective and at least somewhat subjective at the same time? Is it the case that even if you have a countably infinite number of cycles, you can't analyse an uncountably infinite number of options?
2. am I justified in my strong use of the no free lunch theorems?
