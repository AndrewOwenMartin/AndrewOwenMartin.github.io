# Objective - There's a revolution afoot. Which side are you on?

There is talk of a revolution.
If the most vocal advocates are to be believed the world is on the brink of a revolution.
As the industrial revolution automated manual labour, the AI revolution will automate thought.
The most vocal advocates claim that advances in AI will realise a power that will change the world in a qualitative way, others say it represents a procrdural progress in automation.
in this book we will use the example of self driving cars.
We will look at the best reasons for optimism, then some recent challenges, 
<? then some warnings from history and theory that represent logical and philosophical challenges which will not be solved by mere iterative progress. ?>
then some theoretical arguments which describe fundamental challenges.
This book is split into three sections, coded Green, Amber, and Red.

The Green section will draw on reporting from researhers and corporations involved with AVs.
There will be a mix of contemporary success stories and thought on AI from those most interested in presenting a strong appearance.
This chapter will age the least gracefully, around tge time of publication the will be different successes being celebrated in the press and claims and theories ofthose invollved will likely have developed significantly.
Nevertheless this chapter will be valuable for anyone wanting to feel the current level of optimism, or to get a feeling for what was considered to be such bold achoevements as to be portentious of an imminent revolution.
We will see A, B, C.
We will see how they can be interpreted as puzzle pieceswhich combine to form a picture of a bright future.

The Amber section will draw on contemporary setbacks or criticism of the flagship AI projects and thought leaders.
We will find a common thread in the problems and thoughts.
The question remains whetger these are the expected challenges of a developing field which will be overcome one by one until none remain or if they are the merely the many aspects of a fundamental underlying problem which will forever hamstring progress until it is addressed at source.

The Red section will glance away from contemporary issues and ibstead look at timless arguments.
Arguments from theory and ohilosophy which will always be true.
One one hand these arguments are old news, being conceived of before tech was this powerful, but their timeless nature gives the best chance of revealing something about the future, having been written outside of the hype.
