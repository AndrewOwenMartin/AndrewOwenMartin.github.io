# Self-control and intentionality
 We necessarily exist isolated, but have means of making ourselves understood.
 The brain is like a network of collaboration-by-consent networks. Each one choosing for itself whether to listen or ignore certain channels.

Meaning will always be uninterpretable from outside due to its uniqueness and complexity. To discover otherwise would be to have redefined meaning.
Meaning can be shared between those who participate in neuro-regulatory actions like dance, chant or hallucination.

Mental representation is distinct from a mental state.

Representations exist in the world but have no meanings, and meanings exist in the brain absent of representation.

Most actions are performed without being explicitely aware of them.

The big problem is making sense of the stimuli, and this can be done in one of two ways, i) full parsing of all signals, ii) context sensitive interpretation of a portion of the data.
