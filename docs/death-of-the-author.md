As I use the phrase "Death of the author" (or artist), it refers to the question, "Can a piece of art be enjoyed without worrying about the artist itself", put another couple of ways "is it still okay to like Micheal Jackson's music" or, more relevant for me, "is it okay to read Heideggarian Philosophy even though he was a massive nazi".
It's notable at this point that you rarely hear the question "Should I enjoy (piece of art X just because the artist was nice?".

This is a particularly relevant point in something arguably abstract as theoretical computer science where a logical argument is valid or invalid regardless of the morality of the speaker.
My opinion on this subject is to take full advantage of all the ideas of history, but that it is our responsibility to at least know the background and bear it in mind whenever considering the text itself.
So when we hear 1+1=2 from Heidegger (not something I know if they actually wrote) then it's fine to build off that logic, though you should also consider why they were ultimately getting at.
