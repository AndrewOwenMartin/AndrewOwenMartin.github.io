I signed up to two courses on Coursera.

1. Introduction to Quantum Computing (ItQC)
2. Quantum Computing. Less Formulas - More understanding (QCLF-MU)

I've seen the introductory few minutes from both courses, the first one suggested some recommended reading below, the second one seemed like it was a preparatory course for the first one. It seems ItQC presents the facts and maths as they are known, and QCLF-MU goes a bit into why these are the way things are.
